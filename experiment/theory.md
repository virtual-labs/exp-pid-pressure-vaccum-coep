## Introduction 

The measurement of pressure and vacuum plays an extensive and important role in the modern world. The industrial revolution was largely powered by the pressure generated by transforming water into steam, and the need to measure pressure, over wider ranges and with increasing accuracy, has expanded ever since. Applications are found in industries as diverse as nuclear, power, gas, petrochemical, biological, pharmaceutical, meteorological, automotive, environmental, semi-conductor, optical, aerospace, defence, ventilation, filtration and process control in general. The validity of the measurements is essential for trade, efficiency, quality and safety.

Pressure and Vacuum Plant design purpose to identify the variation in static and dynamic characteristics. We have different device communication protocols, manufacturers, accuracy and response time. It will be helpful for future research and selection of an accurate sensor for a particular application area. Here we are doing experiments with 9 pressure transmitters and 5 vacuum transmitters which has different properties.

#### Pressure & vacuum Pilot Plant Insight

The Pressure vacuum Pilot Plant hardware contain the combined setup, but it is operated individually. Both plant has same PLC. Pressure setup has 0 to 10 bar three phase compressor and 9 different properties pressure transmitters (PT1 to PT9 and reference slandered is PT3). Vacuum setup has three phase 0 to -1000 mbar vacuum pump. It has 5 different properties vacuum transmitters VT1 to VT5 and reference standard is VT3.
